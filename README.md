# Python-Projects
Repo for any projects I work on in my free time.

Mostly random/loose stuff

**Codewars:** are challenges from the codewars site

**google_interviews:** working on interview problems from youtube


**maths:** messing around with numbers and such

**riddles-puzzles:** interesting brain teasers and problems like the nugget problem and monty-hall problem

**sandbox:** random stuff normally looking at optimizations

```util.py``` has some good helping functions including a handy timer wrapper ```from util import mytime```
